Following a zombie outbreak, you're one of the lucky ones. You suffered a bite, but unlike the others, you retained your senses.

A group of people like you - the Unturned - have banded together to find the source of the outbreak in the hopes that you can stop it. The militaries of the world are doing their best to stop the spread, but your group know that only the immune can get anywhere near ground zero.

After a lengthy journey, you arrive at the shores of the island where it all began. Only you remain. The others have abandoned the mission, fleeing in fear or suffering injury at the hands of the dead that walk and the many monstrous creatures born from this source.

You are the world's last hope.
